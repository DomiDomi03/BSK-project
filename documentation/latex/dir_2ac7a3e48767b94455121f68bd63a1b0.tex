\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
The main goal of the project is to realize a software tool for emulating the qualified electronic signature, i.\+e. signing \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}.pdf documents. It is important to fully emulate the process, including the hardware toll needed for person identification.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Authors}{Authors}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md1}

The main task of the project is to design and develop an application to make a qualified electronic signature according to PAd\+ES (PDF Advanced Electronic Signature) standard concept. In general, the application must take a form of a set of tools for realization the qualified electronic signature.

The general concept is pointed out in Fig. 1.

Additionally to the main application, user has a 2nd auxiliary application for generating a pair of RSA keys and securing the private key. The encrypted private key will be stored on a pendrive and it will be used for signing the document.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{General usage scenario\+:}{General usage scenario\+:}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md4}


The user A has a hardware tool (a pendrive) with encrypted private RSA key. The key is encrypted by AES algorithm using as a key user’s PIN number. The PIN is given by the user during generating a pair of RSA keys using an auxiliary application. The application for PAd\+ES signature must automatically identify the hardware tool and read the private key to sign the \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}.pdf document. Before signing the document, user A must nenter the PIN number to decrypt the private RSA key. Regarding the concept of PAd\+ES standard, the electronic signature is attached inside \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}.pdf document.

The second user B must have a possibility to verify the signature (using the same application), by having the public key of user A and the signed document. During the verification user B generates the hash from the document and verifies it with the hash generated by user A (after proper RSA decryption).
